One of my interest in google technologies is about its cloud platform. 
In today's era, cloud computing enables hardware and software products to coexist remotely (in the data center) on a large scale. 
Users can access, manage, and use the tools they require via a web-interface.

Google Cloud Platform offers many technologies inside it.
There are many services on Google Cloud Platform that is available. Based on your primary computing needs, there are three categories:
1. IaaS, where the developers can run virtual machines without having to invest in or manage this computing infrastructure themselves
2. PaaS, where the costumer can get underlying infrastructure â€“ like operating systems and middleware. And, 
3. SaaS, where verything is available via the web: the provider hosts, manages, and delivers the entire infrastructure including applications. Users simply log in to access the resources the specific solution delivers, e.g. backup and recovery tools.

Based on service-offering type, Core service categories include:
1. Compute
2. Networking
3. Storage and Databases
4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML)
5. Big Data
6. Identity and Security
7. Management Tools

there are many things that i need to get my hands on. I hope we can thrive together and i can contribute as much as i can.
